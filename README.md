# SharePoint Saturday Source Code
This is the source code for my SharePoint Saturday session:
*Cooking Office 365 Provisioning Solutions - adding some spice with Socket.io*

It is only created to show some concept, it's not production ready and will need a lot of work.

If anybody wants to use this code, please feel free. And if anybody wants to contribute and fix the code, please feel free.
